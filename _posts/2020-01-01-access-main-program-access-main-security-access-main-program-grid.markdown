My name is Alejandro Nanga, I'm a 3D artist from Mexico. I'm currently working with WebGL and VR/AR projects, focusing on level design, environmental art and polygon optimization for platforms with hardware limitations, at Thermo Fisher Scientific.

My workflow consists on scouting, conceptualizing, modeling with Autodesk Maya, texturing with Substance Painter and Adobe Photoshop and then moving to Unity3D with PBR shaders.

I care about processes and their improvements to deliver faster, consistent, high quality work in 3D environments.
