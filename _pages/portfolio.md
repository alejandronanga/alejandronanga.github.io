A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a vaccines manufacturing facility was created, this was further implemented into a Mixed Reality training for operators. Every single piece of the assembly was implemented into a guided interactive training for the Hololens 2, and Oculus in Unity.

The implementation of this assembly, among other manufacturing plants, have helped cut training costs and time.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling the environment, assembly parts, among other assets; optimization of design files, and other assets; UVing, and texturing. I was also responsible for the project implementation and project management, following Agile principles.

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility was created, this is to be used on Mixed Reality platforms for sales and for further population with instruments that could have a training intent.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling and populating the environments and instruments; UVing and texturing; implementation. I was also responsible for the project implementation and project management, following Agile principles.

### iCELLis Bioreactor Guide
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0tV0ACe.png" alt="iCELLis project">

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group and Viral Vector Services. Based on purely photographic and video references provided, an optimized reproduction of the iCELLis Bioreactor 500, a LAUDA Pro Circulation Thermostat, and other training materials were reproduced. Every single piece of the assembly was implemented into a guided interactive training for the Hololens 2, and Oculus in Unity.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling, UVing, texturing, and animating the bioreactor. I was also responsible for its implementation.

A POC for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on CAD data and photographic references, an optimized reproduction of a vial washer for pharmaceutical plants was created, and a training for the Hololens 2 was implemented for the Washer operators.

In this project, my role consisted of: retopology of CAD files, 3D modeling, texturing and animating. Altoura was responsible of its implementation.

You can watch a demo run on the training <a href="https://vimeo.com/501898364">here</a>.

WebGL trainings for new instruments from Thermo Fisher Scientific's training divisions. Including workflows for basic essay runs and setting up your new instrument. Five iterations were done: An initial POC, EVOS M5000, QuantStudio 1, Qubit Flex and QuantStudio 3/5. They are all available on their training webpage <a href="https://test.apps.thermofisher.com/apps/lms/#/vr-manuals">here</a>. And a Qubit Flex training is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/edt-vrapps-qubitdss-prod-website/qubitdss/index.html">here</a> if you don't wish to create a TFS account.

In this project, my role consisted of: Retolopology of CAD files for instruments, modeling environments and accesories, texturing, lighting, animations, event system functionality, UI elements with Unity, and features implementation with C# and Rider.
