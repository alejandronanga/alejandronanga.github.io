A POC for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on CAD data and photographic references, an optimized reproduction of a vial washer for pharmaceutical plants was created, and a training for the Hololens 2 was implemented for the operator teams.

I was responsible of retopology of CAD files, 3D modeling, texturing and animating. Altoura was responsible of implementation.

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility was created, this is to be used on Mixed Reality platforms for sales and for further population with instruments that could have a training intent.

I was responsible of 3D modeling and populating the environments and instruments, and texturing. I also had to solve some task managing challenges following Agile principles.

Short video game for the Oculus Go where you swap competitors instruments for others. Three laboratories were created: Cell biology, molecular biology and protein biology.

I was responsible of: Scouting laboratories, level design, 3D modeling all the environments, texturing, 3D modeling competitor's instruments, 3D modeling weapons, animations, particles and splatter effects, renders for swap sprites, UI elements with Unity.

WebGL trainings to set new instruments by Thermo Fisher Scientific divisions. Including workflows for basic essay runs and setting up your new instrument. Five iterations were done: POC, EVOS M5000, QuantStudio 1, Qubit Flex and QuantStudio 3/5.
