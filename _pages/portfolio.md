A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility was created, this is to be used on Mixed Reality platforms for sales and for further population with instruments that could have a training intent.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling and populating the environments and instruments, and texturing. I also had to solve some task managing challenges following Agile principles.

### iCELLis Bioreactor Guide

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group and Viral Vector Services. Based on purely photographic and video references provided, an optimized reproduction of the iCELLis Bioreactor 500, a LAUDA Pro Circulation Thermostat, and other training materials were reproduced, and its assembly was animated.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling, UVing, texturing, and animating the bioreactor and secondary assets for a Hololens 2 training application.

Short video game for the Oculus Go where you swap competitors instruments for others. Three laboratories were created: Cell biology, molecular biology and protein biology.

In this project, my role consisted of: Scouting laboratories, level design, 3D modeling all the environments, texturing, 3D modeling competitor's instruments, 3D modeling weapons, animations, particles and splatter effects, renders for swap sprites, UI elements with Unity.

WebGL trainings to set new instruments by Thermo Fisher Scientific divisions. Including workflows for basic essay runs and setting up your new instrument. Five iterations were done: POC, EVOS M5000, QuantStudio 1, Qubit Flex and QuantStudio 3/5. Available <a href="https://test.apps.thermofisher.com/apps/lms/#/vr-manuals">here</a>, or <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/edt-vrapps-qubitdss-prod-website/qubitdss/index.html">here</a> if you don't want to create an account.

In this project, my role consisted of: Retolopology of CAD files for instruments, modeling environments and accesories, texturing, lighting, animations, highligh system with C#, event system functionality, UI elements with Unity.

### Line 2 Washer Guide

A POC for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on CAD data and photographic references, an optimized reproduction of a vial washer for pharmaceutical plants was created, and a training for the Hololens 2 was implemented for the operator teams.

In this project, my role consisted of: retopology of CAD files, 3D modeling, texturing and animating. Altoura was responsible of implementation.

You can watch a demo run on the training <a href="https://vimeo.com/501898364">here</a>.
