## <b>Experience</b>
### Thermo Fisher Scientific (2017 - Present)
#### 3D Graphics Artist (2020 - Present)
My current role is working with Pharma Services Global to deliver realistic 3D replicas of Thermo Fisher's pharmaceutical laboratories, factories and equipment in PBR with a very low hardware cost, parting from scans, CAD files or photographic references for AR applications on the Hololens 2. Delivering with this, training experiences when in person trainings are not possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Software Engineer I / 3D Developer (2017 - 2020)
From 2017 to 2020, I was an interdisciplinary developer in a Scrum team for the Digital Engineering division.

In this position I developed multiple 3D assets; depending on the project, it comprised retopology of biotechnology equipment from CAD files, creating new low poly environments and props from scratch, conceptualizing environments, level design and animations for applications on WebGL and VR/AR platforms like Oculus Go, HTC Vive and Meta 2 in trainings in the field of PCR workflows, installation of new equipment, games for sales, and other experiences.

I was also responsible for particle systems, rendering, lighting, implementation of UI mock ups in Unity and its functionality, developing features with C# using TDD; with optimization as a priority to achieve smooth experiences.

I also worked on other experimental projects, like the interconnection of a virtual environment with the HTC Vive and an Spinnaker Microplate Robot in Carlsbad, California; and as part of my development goals I provided courses on the creation of 3D assets for video games for interested coworkers from different backgrounds in software development.
