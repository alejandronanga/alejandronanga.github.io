### Carlsbad Fermenter Project (WIP)
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/AcGMSaS.png" alt="Carlsbad Fermenter Project">

A Mixed Reality project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic references, an interactive digital twin of an ABEC fermenter was created. This is a work in progress, a Digital Twin was created under the polygon and draw calls limits of the Hololens 2. All assemblies, tools, and tubes, will be animated for an immersive experience setting up the fermenter, according to SOPs.

This project will help cutting training costs and time; and the added benefit of remote training, allowing the user to complete an assembly run without entering a sterile zone.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling of the assembly line, parts, and other assets; optimization of design files; UVing, and texturing. I was also responsible for the project implementation and project management, following Agile principles.

A Mixed Reality project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an interactive digital twin of a vaccines manufacturing facility was created. The interactions were created in Unity for training porpuses regarding the assembly of the line interal parts. Every single piece was animated as instruction animations allowing the user to manipulate the interactive pieces in place during a training experience. This was done for the Hololens 2, and Oculus devices.

While I can only show the finished model in most cases and not its MR implementation, this project has helped cut training costs and time; and the added benefit of remote training, allowing the user to complete an assembly run without entering a sterile zone.

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and limited photogrammetry data provided, an optimized reproduction of a vaccines manufacturing facility was created, this was further implemented into a Mixed Reality training for operators. Every single piece of the assembly was implemented into a guided interactive training for the Hololens 2, and Oculus in Unity.

While I can only show the finished model in most cases and not its MR implementation, this project has helped cut training costs and time; and the added benefit of remote training, allowing the user to complete an assembly run without entering a sterile zone.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling the environment, assembly parts, among other assets; optimization of design files, and other assets; UVing, and texturing. I was also responsible for the project implementation and project management, following Agile principles.

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group. Based on photographic and photogrammetry data provided, an optimized digital twin of a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility was created, this is to be used on Mixed Reality platforms for sales and for further population with instruments that could have a training intent.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling and populating the environments and instruments; UVing and texturing; implementation. I was also responsible for the project implementation and project management, following Agile principles.

### iCELLis Bioreactor Guide

A project for Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group and Viral Vector Services. Based on purely photographic and video references provided, an optimized reproduction of the iCELLis Bioreactor 500, a LAUDA Pro Circulation Thermostat, and other training materials were reproduced. Every single piece of the assembly was implemented into a guided interactive training for the Hololens 2, and Oculus in Unity.

In this project, my role consisted of: 3D modeling, UVing, texturing, and animating the bioreactor. I was also responsible for its implementation.

This was the first project I participated with Thermo Fisher Scientific's Pharma Services Group, in collaboration with Altoura, as an introduction to their Mixed Reality tools and solutions. We implemented a full training on assembling and disassembling specific change parts on a Vial Washer for the Hololens 2.

My main focus on this project was the retoplogy of provided CAD files, and 3D modeling the Washer skeleton and secondary assets based on photographic material, UVing, texturing, and animating the vial washer. This minding the draw calls and polycount limit for the Hololens 2. Altoura helped with the implementation.

You can watch a local demo run on the training <a href="https://vimeo.com/501898364">here</a>.

They are all available on their training webpage <a href="https://test.apps.thermofisher.com/apps/lms/#/vr-manuals">here</a>. And a Qubit Flex training is available <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/edt-vrapps-qubitdss-prod-website/qubitdss/index.html">here</a> if you don't wish to create a TFS account.

In this project, my role consisted of: Retolopology of CAD files for instruments, 3D modeling environments and accesories, texturing, lighting, animations, event system functionality, implementing the project's UI, and feature implementation with C# and Rider.
