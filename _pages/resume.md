## <b>Experience</b>
### Thermo Fisher Scientific (2017 - Present)
#### 3D Artist II (2020 - Present)
I'm currently working with Pharma Services Global, a Thermo Fisher Scientific (TFS) division, supporting the creation of Mixed Reality trainings to aid the operators of multiple vaccine manufacturing plants in the UK, the US, and Italy, in a partnership with Microsoft and a MR deployment platform named Altoura.

Here I've taken the lead in recreating facilities and machinery in a low-poly approach, with a focus on delivering high-quality environments and assets, with a very low hardware cost, due to the limitations of current AR equipment like Microsoft's Hololens 2, and Mobile; and less so, for Desktop and VR applications.

My role has comprised (not limited to) retopology, 3D modeling, texturing, UVing, animation, shaders, asset management, Unity's UI implementation, tools, training implementation, among others. I've also been responsible for project management, using Agile principles.

The result has been decreased costs and time on training, for complete assemblies and manufacturing plants for TFS operators; alongside the benefit of providing remote approaches for training and support around the globe; in a digital transformation effort in Thermo Fisher Scientific.

#### Software Engineer I (3D Developer) (2017 - 2020)
From 2017 to 2020, I was under the Digital Engineering division in TFS. I was an interdisciplinary developer in a Scrum team, where I developed multiple applications alongside other talented Software Engineers. I was the person creating all the 3D assets and environments for our Virtual Reality (Oculus Go, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive), AR (Hololens 2, Meta 2), and WebGL experiences.

My work was comprised of low-poly biotechnology equipment, created from photographic references or design files; low-poly environments and props; level design; animation; particle systems; rendering; UI/UX implementation; C# programming for Unity using Test Driven Development practices; shaders; among other competencies.

The projects ranged in guided trainings for TFS equipment installation and use; marketing experiences; and scientific learning experiences. Mostly for cost-saving and equipment-selling purposes. I also worked on other experimental projects and POCs, that were later concreted into specialized teams inside the company.

Furthermore, I provided courses on the creation of 3D assets and other media, for video games and XR applications; for interested colleagues from different backgrounds in software development.


### Vicom (2017)
#### Intern in Media
At Vicom I was an intern in media as an undergrad. My role was filling the gap between disciplines in the media department. Among my responsibilities were the creation of 2D assets for motion graphics; 2D animation; assisting at brand storytelling; scouting; assisting production; and product photography.
