## <b>Experience</b>
### Thermo Fisher Scientific (2017 - Present)
#### 3D Artist II (2020 - Present)
I’m currently working with Pharma Services Global, a Thermo Fisher Scientific division, supporting the creation of Mixed Reality trainings to aid the operators of multiple vaccine manufacturing plants around the globe.

In this role I’ve taken the lead in recreating facilities and machinery in a low-poly approach, with a focus on creating high-quality environments and props, with a very low hardware cost; and implementing them into VR and AR trainings using Unity. Resulting in decreased costs and time on training sessions, with the added benefit of providing remote support, and training outside of sterile environments.

My current work focus comprises (not limited to): 3D modeling, retopology of CAD files, texturing, UVing, animation, shaders, particle systems, asset management, UI implementation in Unity, tools, training implementation, project management with Agile principles, among others.

#### Software Engineer I (3D Developer) (2017 - 2020)
In this position, I developed multiple 3D assets; depending on the project, it comprised retopology of CAD files, conceptualizing and modeling low-poly environments and props, level design, animation, C# development with TDD for applications on WebGL and VR/AR platforms, like the Oculus Go, Oculus Rift/Quest, HTC Vive, and Meta 2; for trainings and game experiences in the field of biotechnology and science: PCR workflows, equipment assembly, games for marketing, among other experiences.

### Vicom (2017)
#### Intern in Media
At Vicom, my role as an undergrad intern consisted in filling the gap between disciplines in the media department. I oversaw creating 2D assets for motion graphics; 2D animation in Adobe After Effects; assisting at brand storytelling; assisting production; and product photography.
