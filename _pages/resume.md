## <b>Experience</b>
### Thermo Fisher Scientific (2017 - Present)
#### 3D Artist II (2020 - Present)
I'm working with Pharma Services Global, a divison of Thermo Fisher Scientific, to deliver Mixed Reality trainings and aid the assembly of new vaccination plants in the UK and US, in a partnership with Altoura and Microsoft. My role is recreating plants and machinery in low poly and PBR with a very low hardware cost, parting from photographic references, some CAD files and Matterport scans.

I'm also responsible for recreating user interfaces from the multiple environments, and overall animations for the trainings.

#### Software Engineer I / 3D Developer (2017 - 2020)
From 2017 to 2020, I was an interdisciplinary developer in a Scrum team for the Digital Engineering division.

In this position I developed multiple 3D assets; depending on the project, it comprised retopology of biotechnology equipment from CAD files, creating new low poly environments and props from scratch, conceptualizing environments, level design and animations for applications on WebGL and VR/AR platforms like Oculus Go, HTC Vive and Meta 2 in trainings in the field of PCR workflows, installation of new equipment, games for sales, and other experiences.

I was also responsible for particle systems, rendering, lighting, implementation of UI mock ups in Unity and its functionality, developing features with C# using TDD; with optimization as a priority to achieve smooth experiences.

I also worked on other experimental projects, like the interconnection of a virtual environment with the HTC Vive and an Spinnaker Microplate Robot in Carlsbad, California; and as part of my development goals I provided courses on the creation of 3D assets for video games for interested coworkers from different backgrounds in software development.


### Vicom (2017)
#### Intern in Media
At Vicom I was an intern in media as an undergrad. My role was filling the gap between disciplines in the media department. Among my responsibilities were the creation of 2D assets for motion graphics; 2D animation; assisting at brand storytelling; scouting; assisting production; and product photography.
